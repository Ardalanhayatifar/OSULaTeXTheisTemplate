  abstract = {Abstract Energy is a critical issue for Africa, where large number of people do not have access to energy. Energy recovery from waste can play a role in minimising the impact of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) on the environment with the additional benefit of providing a local source of energy. This study was carried out to assess, at the African level, the role which waste could play in providing energy to citizens and provides an estimate of the total potential of energy from waste incineration and from landfill gas (LFG). The results show an energy potential of all waste generated in Africa of 1125PJ in 2012 and 2199PJ in 2025. Nevertheless, if energy recovery through LFG is considered, about 155PJ could be recovered in 2012 and 363PJ in 2025 if waste actually collected, or projected to be collected, is considered. The electricity generation could reach 62.5TWh in 2012 and 122.2TWh in 2025, in case of full waste collection, compared with electricity consumption in Africa of 661.5TWh in 2010. If waste actually collected is considered, these estimates decrease respectively to 34.1TWh in 2012 and 83.8TWh in 2025. Apart from continental estimates, the study provides detailed information at the country level and a vision of the spatial distribution of energy from waste based on the city population in major African cities.},

  abstract = {Abstract An increasing interest in magnetotelluric monitoring of hydraulic stimulation experiments and of natural earthquakes currently requires a detailed investigation of the limits of this method. Our study contributes to this discussion with a unique quasi-continuous and long-term magnetotelluric monitoring of different injection and production experiments at the Rittershoffen geothermal site in Alsace (France). Here, we provide a first evaluation of the data and an outlook on more specific challenges. The geothermal doublet at Rittershoffen is operated through two wells GRT1 and GRT2. The magnetotelluric monitoring covers the end of drilling phase of GRT2, mostly, production from, but also injection into this well, injection into GRT1 and a circulation experiment. Magnetotelluric data were processed successfully using remote referencing. Transfer functions show particular variation pattern for different operations, i.e. an increase in uncertainty, conductivity and phase during test operation with a preferential direction sub-parallel to Shmin, i.e. perpendicular to the expected extension of the fractures controlling the reservoir. In particular fluid injection, either into GRT2 or GRT1 causes a strong decrease in resistivity by up to one order of magnitude in the YX component between about 8–25s of period. However, the comparison between the temporal distribution of the occurring anomalies and the magnetic field intensity reveals an amplifying effect on the anomalies. In conclusion, we confirm earlier findings on the influence of the magnetic field intensity on magnetotelluric monitoring and at the same time show the lower limit of monitoring in particular monitoring of injection into deep geothermal reservoirs.},
